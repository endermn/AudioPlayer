## A currently being worked on Audio Player for linux and mac.

This project was created to attempt improving already existing audio players, that unfortunately have some missing features on mac/linux

The main issues this project is trying to solve is:

* Better support for playing local files
* Structurizing the files' paths

## To compile you can do the following:

1. clone this project
2. install meson (you can learn more about how to do that on their page)
3. run ```meson setup build``` to create the build directory
4. open it with ```cd build``` 
5. run ```meson compile```
6. open your executable
